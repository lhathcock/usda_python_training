    "## Why We Might Want to Compute Plant Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Late in the growing season, when canopies of various crops close together, getting plant\n",
    "stand counts won't work via image recognition, and perhaps we don't want to send someone out\n",
    "into the field to count the crops manually at this stage. So we turn to photogrammetry to\n",
    "estimate plant volume, which can provide a stand-in for biomass measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Photogrammetry and DSMs\n",
    "\n",
    "The way photogrammetry works is by creating a set of key points in overlapping imagery\n",
    "(from a drone, for instance), and creates a point cloud out of this data. At this point, a\n",
    "digital surface model (DSM) can be produced from the point cloud, and the collected imagery\n",
    "can be mapped onto this DSM, creating an orthomosaic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point cloud produced is similar to that produced by a LIDAR payload, however the difference\n",
    "is that since passive sensors (i.e. an imaging camera) are used, photogrammetry has no ability\n",
    "to penetrate the canopy, so produces a DSM, which is a representation of the surface of objects\n",
    "in the field of view. LIDAR, being an active sensor, has some degree of canopy penetration, and\n",
    "as such can produce digital elevation models (DEMs) as well as DSMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only need the surface model for this application. Photogrammetric methods can produce very\n",
    "dense point clouds, so for our purposes it should perform very well."
