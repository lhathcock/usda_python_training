    "Most folks in the agricultural field are aware of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This attempts\n",
    "to capture the health of a plant via the NIR and Red bands. Healthy plants strongly absorb red light at the top of\n",
    "the canopy, while NIR reflects very strongly. The ranges for NDVI are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Value | Class |\n",
    "|-----|-----|\n",
    "| -1.0 to 0.0 | Dead/non-plants |\n",
    "| 0.0 to 0.33 | Unhealthy plant |\n",
    "|0.33 to 0.66 | Moderately healthy plant |\n",
    "|0.66 to 1.0 | Very healthy plant |\n",
    "\n",
    "## NDRE\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE) replaces the red band with the red edge band, which is much more sensitive to leaf nitrogen content. It is\n",
    "suitable for permanent or dense crops, and will be more accurate for crops almost ready for harvest. This is what\n",
    "we're going to use for this application, although we're also going to visualize NDVI. Values look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Value | Class |\n",
    "|-----|-----|\n",
    "| -1.0 to 0.1 | Bad/no N uptake |\n",
    "| 0.1 to 0.3 | Weak N uptake |\n",
