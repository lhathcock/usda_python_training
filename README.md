Jupyter notebook created in Anaconda 3.0 environment.

Required libraries are gdal, matplotlib, opencv, and numpy. gdal may ask to
downgrade the installed version of numpy, but can be forced to *not*
upgrade and shouldn't affect this notebook.

Install in conda prompt:

conda install matplotlib
conda install opencv
conda install gdal

matplotlib should grab numpy as a dependency.
